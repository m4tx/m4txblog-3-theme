# [m4txblog³ theme](http://m4tx.pl/)

m4txblog³ theme is the WordPress theme I use on my blog - [m4txblog](http://m4tx.pl). m4txblog³ theme uses [Roots Starter Theme](http://roots.io/starter-theme/) as its base and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) as its UI.

## Features
* Most of the features of Roots - HTML5 Boilerplate, jQuery and Modernizr included, ARIA roles, clean HTML output...
* Bootstrap-enabled versions of basic widgets (Categories, Recent Comments, Links, Tag Cloud)
* HiDPI display support

## Building
m4txblog³, since its based on Roots Starter Theme, uses Grunt for building CSS (from LESS sources) and checking JavaScript for errors. You'll need Grunt if you want to build a copy of m4txblog³ for yourself. You can find detailed instructions on the [Roots website](http://roots.io/using-grunt-for-wordpress-theme-development/).

## License
m4txblog³ theme code is released under [the MIT License](LICENSE.md).
